    "# Atrial Fibrillation Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to detect periods of AF from preprocessed ECG data by detecting irregular R-R intervals in the ECG signals. Different Machine Learning Classifiers are used to build an ML model using the given data. The performance of these various classifiers are analysed to determine the best classifier for this data. This is an interactive notebook that displays the results of our work. The entire source code can be found at the [GitHub](https://github.com/rushvanth/AFDetection) repository. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is highly recommended to run this Notebook in [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) in a GPU backed runtime. This drastically reduces run times while training models. In some cases, training time can be reduced from >5 hours (CPU processing - i7 1135G7) to ~4 minutes(GPU processing - NVIDIA T4). \n"
